The new Infinite Craft.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a work-in-progress. 

- For contributing read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- For the ToDo list read [TODO.md](TODO.md)

## Goals

- Re-make the game completely from scratch
- Provide a flexible API for developers to make their own mods and themes for Infinite Craft. Also our own catalouge of modifications and themes, allowing people to install them very easily.
- A lot of Quality of Life features that the original Infinite Craft does not have - better accessibility, customization (such as appearance settings or custom keybinds) and much more
- All features should be toggleable or configurable through the settings menu
- Our own gameplay elements (challenges, gamemodes, experience system, etc) to make the game more fun and replayable
